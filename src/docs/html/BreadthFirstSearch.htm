<p><b>Necessary graph state</b>:<br>
  A breadth-first search is implemented on undirected graphs. (Graphs can be weighted 
  or non-weighted.)</p>
<p><b>User input required</b>:<br>
  You select a starting node and a search value to find.</p>
<p><b>Description</b>:<br>
  This algorithm searches for a specified value in a graph from a given starting 
  node. The search starts by reaching to all nodes adjacent to the starting node 
  in any direction, attempting to find the given value. Nodes are marked as visited 
  along the way. If the value is found, the algorithm reports that the value is 
  located in the graph, along with the pathway from the starting node to the location 
  of the search value. While the search value is not found, the algorithm continues 
  from all of the adjacent nodes to visit all nodes immediately next to each, 
  and so on, visiting all nodes that have not yet been visited. Execution stops 
  when the search value is located or when the algorithm can reach no more non-visited 
  nodes. More than one breadth-first search solution may exist for the same starting 
  node and search value on the same graph.</p>
