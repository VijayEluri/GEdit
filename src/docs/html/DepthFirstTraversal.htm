<p align="left"><b>Necessary graph state</b>:<br>
  A depth-first traversal is implemented on undirected graphs. (Graphs can be 
  weighted or non-weighted.) </p>
<p><b>User input required</b>:<br>
  You select a starting node.</p>
<p><b>Description</b>:<br>
  This algorithm returns all possible vertices of the graph that are reachable 
  from the given starting node. The vertices are returned in a sequence that reaches 
  as far as possible from the starting node in any direction until it can go no 
  further. Then it backtracks along that sequence node by node, reaching out in 
  similar fashion as far as possible from each node in every possible direction, 
  visiting all nodes that have not yet been visited. Execution stops when the 
  algorithm can reach no more non-visited nodes. More than one depth-first traversal 
  may exist for the same starting node in the same graph.</p>
