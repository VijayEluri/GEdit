<p><b><font size="4">Graph State Settings as Related to Algorithm Execution</font></b></p>
<p>Any graph has two characteristics concerning the state of its egdes. The first 
  has to do with edge direction(1), and the second deals with edge weights(2).</p>
<p><b>1. Directed versus Undirected Graphs:</b><br>
  <b>a</b>. <i>Directed Graphs</i>: In a directed graph, each edge can be traversed 
  in only one direction, specified by an arrow.<br>
  <b>b</b>. <i>Undirected Graphs</i>: In an undirected graph, each edge can be 
  travesed in either direction between the two nodes it connects. </p>
<p><b>2. Weighted versus Non-weighted Graphs:</b><br>
  <b>a</b>. <i>Weighted Graphs</i>: In a weighted graph, associated with each 
  edge is a value representing the cost or distance necessary to travel between 
  the two nodes it connects.<br>
  <b>b</b>. <i>Non-weighted Graphs</i>: In a non-weighted graph, each edge merely 
  denotes the fact that two edges are connected, with no associated weight value.</p>
<p>Each graph algorithm requires specific edge states in order to execute. For 
  example, the spanning tree and minimum spanning tree algorithms require undirected 
  graphs, while the shortest path and all-pairs shortest path algorithms require 
  directed graphs. For this reason, only certain algorithms can be executed on 
  any given graph,depending on its edge states. For a listing of the states required 
  for any algorithm, select the algorithm in the <a href="algorithms.htm">main 
  algorithms index</a>.</p>
