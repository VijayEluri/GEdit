<p><b><font size="4">Depth-first Search</font></b></p>
<p><b>Necessary graph state</b>:<br>
  A depth-first search is implemented on undirected graphs. (Graphs can be weighted 
  or non-weighted.)</p>
<p><b>User input required</b>:<br>
  You select a starting node and a search value to find.</p>
<p><b>Description</b>:<br>
  This algorithm searches for a specified value in a graph from a given starting 
  node. The search reaches as far as possible from the starting node in any direction 
  attempting to find the given value. Nodes are marked as visited along the way. 
  If the value is found, the algorithm reports that the value is located in the 
  graph, along with the pathway from the starting node to the location of the 
  search value. While the search value is not found, the algorithm continues in 
  to expand outward in one direction until it can go no further because no more 
  nodes are present or because all nodes that it encounters are already visited. 
  Then it backtracks along the search sequence node by node, searching outward 
  in similar fashion as far as possible from each node in every possible direction, 
  visiting all nodes that have not yet been visited. Execution stops when the 
  search value is located or when the algorithm can reach no more non-visited 
  nodes. More than one depth-first search solution may exist for the same starting 
  node and search value in the same graph.</p>
