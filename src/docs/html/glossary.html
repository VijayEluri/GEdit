(Outlined in Chapter 12, Sahni, &quot;<i>Data Structures, Algorithms, and Applications 
in C++</i>&quot;)
<p><b>Graph</b>: A collection of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges.</p>
<p><b>Node (or vertex)</b>: A point in a graph, connected to other nodes by edges.</p>
<p><b>Edge</b>: A connection between two nodes in a graph. Can be either directed 
  or undirected.</p>
<p><b>Directed Graph</b>: Graph containing all edges with directed (one way) orientations.</p>
<p><b>Undirected Graph</b>: Graph containing all edges with no directional orientation.</p>
<p><b>Adjacent Nodes</b>: Two nodes incident to the same edge.</p>
<p><b>Weighted Graph</b>: A graph where weights are assigned to each edge. Weighted 
  edges can thus be compared with each other.</p>
<p><b>Path</b>: A collection of incident nodes and edges, starting at a given 
  node and ending at another node.</p>
<p><b>Simple Path</b>: A path where all nodes (but start and end nodes) are unique.</p>
<p><b>Length of Path</b>: Sum of all edges contained in the path.</p>
<p><b>Subgraph</b>: A subset of nodes and edges of another graph.</p>
<p><b>Connected Graph</b>: A graph is connected if there is a path between any 
  pair of nodes.</p>
<p><b>Cycle</b>: A cycle is a path where the starting node is the same as the 
  end node.</p>
<p><b>Tree</b>: An undirected graph that is connected and doesn't have any cycles.</p>
<p><b>Spanning Tree</b>: A subgraph tree of a connected graph that connects all 
  nodes in the graph.</p>
<p><b>Miminum Spanning Tree</b>: A spanning tree on a weighted graph with the 
  smallest possible total edge weight.</p>
<p><b>Degree (of a Node)</b>: The number of undirected nodes incident to a node.</p>
<p><b>In-Degree (of a Node)</b>: The number of directed edges coming into the 
  node.</p>
<p><b>Out-Degree (of a Node)</b>: The number of directed edges leaving a node.</p>
<p><b>Complete Graph</b>: A graph with an edge between all possible node pairs.</p>
<p><b>Adjacency Matrix</b>: A matrix used as a method of storing edges between 
  pairs of nodes.</p>
<p><b>Connected Component</b>: A collection of nodes such that any pair of the 
  nodes is connected by a path.</p>
